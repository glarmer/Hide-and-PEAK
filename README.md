## Features

* Custom taunt sounds for Hiders.
* Host-controlled timing and intervals for sounds.
* Team selection UI and in-game scoreboard.
* Grace period for Hiders at the start of each round.
* Player stats tracking including catches and deaths.
* Easy-to-use configuration menu (F9) for controlling the game.

## Configuration

* You can open the configuration menu with **F9**. Options include:

  * Taunt start time
  * Taunt interval
  * Hider grace period
  * Seeker voice toggle
  * Name color customization

### Sound Customisation

Similar to Garry's Mod Prophunt, this hide and seek mod features a configurable sound based taunt system, when you install the mod a `/sounds/` folder will be in the same directory as the mod, you can place any .wav file you like in here but you need to make sure that you and the host have the same wavs, otherwise you will not hear the taunts. By default some simple comedic sounds are in the folder, so the mod is ready to go after being installed.

## Important Notes

* **Sounds folder:** The `sounds` folder in your plugin directory **must contain the exact set of WAV files** used by the host. Missing or mismatched files will result in you not hearing taunts.
* Everyone needs this mod installed
* Do **not** report bugs to the game developers while using mods. Test without mods first to ensure issues are truly game-related.
* Only download the mod from official sources to avoid malware.
* Sounds sourced from: [WavSource](https://www.wavsource.com/)
